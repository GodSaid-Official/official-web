        <p class="intro">
            I used to set my alarm 30 minutes early to pray, then hit snooze until I had to rush out the door. Sound familiar? After years of failed "prayer warrior" attempts, I finally found something that works: a simple 5-minute routine that I've actually stuck with for over a year now.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Let me be clear: I'm not a morning person. I don't wake up at 4:30 AM. I don't have a prayer closet. I'm just someone who wanted to start their day with God but kept failing at elaborate routines. If that's you, this might help.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why My Previous Prayer Routines Failed</h2>
        
        <div class="mistake-box">
            <strong>üö´ My Past Mistakes:</strong>
            <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px;">
                <li>Trying to pray for 30-60 minutes right away</li>
                <li>Following someone else's "perfect" routine</li>
                <li>Making it too complicated with journals, apps, and lists</li>
                <li>Beating myself up when I missed a day</li>
                <li>Not having a specific time or place</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            The breakthrough came when I stopped trying to be a "prayer warrior" and just focused on being consistent. Five minutes. Every morning. That's it.
        </p>
        
        <h2>My Actual 5-Minute Routine (With Real Times)</h2>
        
        <div class="routine-box">
            <div class="time-breakdown">
                <strong>‚è∞ The Exact Breakdown:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>0:00-0:30 - Gratitude (30 seconds)</strong><br>
                Before I even open my eyes, I say "Thank you God for..." and name 3 things. Usually simple: my bed, my coffee maker, my family still breathing.<br><br>
                
                <strong>0:30-1:30 - Today's Main Thing (1 minute)</strong><br>
                I tell God about the ONE thing I'm most anxious about today. Just one. Not my whole to-do list.<br><br>
                
                <strong>1:30-3:30 - Scripture or Devotion (2 minutes)</strong><br>
                I either read today's verse from my app or recall one I know. No pressure to memorize perfectly.<br><br>
                
                <strong>3:30-4:30 - Prayer for Others (1 minute)</strong><br>
                Quick prayers for 2-3 specific people. I keep it simple: "Bless Sarah's job interview" not a 10-minute intercession.<br><br>
                
                <strong>4:30-5:00 - Closing (30 seconds)</strong><br>
                "Help me see You today. Amen." That's literally it.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Game-Changers That Made It Stick</h2>
        
        <h3>1. I Do It IN Bed</h3>
        <p>
            Controversial? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely. I don't get up, kneel, or even sit up. I stay under my warm covers with my eyes closed. The barrier to entry is literally zero.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. I Set a Timer</h3>
        <p>
            5 minutes. When it goes off, I'm done. No guilt about not praying "enough." This removed all the pressure and actually made me want to pray more throughout the day.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. I Use the Same Opening Line</h3>
        <p>
            Every single morning starts with: "Good morning God, thank you for..." Having a standard opening eliminated the "how do I start?" paralysis.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4. I Don't Beat Myself Up for Missing Days</h3>
        <p>
            If I miss a morning, I don't "make up for it" or feel guilty. I just start again the next day. This removed the shame cycle that killed my previous attempts.
        </p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong>
            Put your phone across the room with the alarm labeled "5-min prayer time." You have to get up to turn it off, but then you can get back in bed to pray. It's the perfect compromise.
        </div>
        
        <h2>What Happened After 30 Days</h2>
        
        <p>
            I didn't part the Red Sea or suddenly become super spiritual. But here's what did happen:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>I stopped dreading mornings (mostly)</li>
            <li>My anxiety about the day decreased noticeably</li>
            <li>I started spontaneously praying during the day</li>
            <li>I actually wanted to extend it to 7-8 minutes some days</li>
            <li>My kids noticed I was calmer in the morning chaos</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            The biggest change? Prayer stopped feeling like a chore on my spiritual checklist and started feeling like a conversation with a friend.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How to Start Your Own 5-Minute Routine</h2>
        
        <h3>Week 1: Just Show Up</h3>
        <p>
            Don't worry about doing it "right." Just set a timer for 5 minutes and talk to God. If you run out of things to say after 2 minutes, sit in silence. The goal is consistency, not perfection.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Week 2: Find Your Format</h3>
        <p>
            Try my format above, or create your own. Maybe you prefer all gratitude, or all scripture reading. There's no wrong way if you're showing up.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Week 3: Lock In Your Trigger</h3>
        <p>
            Attach prayer to something you already do. For me, it's right after my alarm. For you, it might be after you start the coffee or before you check your phone.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Week 4: Evaluate and Adjust</h3>
        <p>
            What's working? What's not? Don't be afraid to tweak. This is YOUR routine with God, not mine or anyone else's.
        </p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>‚ú® The Secret:</strong>
            Start stupidly small. If 5 minutes feels too long, do 2 minutes. If every day feels impossible, aim for 3 days a week. Build the habit first, then expand it.
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Unexpected Benefits</h2>
        
        <p>
            A year into this routine, here's what surprised me most:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>I pray more throughout the day now</strong> - Starting the morning with prayer made it natural to pray during my commute, lunch break, and bedtime.</li>
            
            <li><strong>My kids started joining me</strong> - They sometimes crawl into bed for the last minute. It's messy and beautiful.</li>
            
            <li><strong>I'm less rigid about "spiritual disciplines"</strong> - The consistency in this one small area gave me freedom to be more flexible in others.</li>
            
            <li><strong>My relationship with God feels more real</strong> - Less performance, more conversation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Your Turn</h2>
        
        <p>
            Tomorrow morning, set a timer for 5 minutes. Don't overthink it. Don't prepare. Just talk to God like you'd talk to a friend over coffee. Start with "Good morning God" and see what happens.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Remember: God isn't impressed by perfect prayers. He just wants to hear from you. Five imperfect minutes beats zero perfect minutes every single time.
        </p>
