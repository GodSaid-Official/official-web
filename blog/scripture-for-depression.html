            Some mornings, I can't get out of bed. Not won't – can't. The weight on my chest is so heavy that even breathing feels like work. If that's you today, this is for you. No judgment. No "just pray more" advice. Just verses that have kept me alive when I wanted to disappear.

        <h2>When You Can't Even Form Words to Pray</h2>
        
        <p>
            There are days when "Dear God" is as far as I get before the tears come. On those days, I've learned that's enough. Here's what helps:
        </p>
        
        <div class="verse-card">
            <strong>"The Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans."</strong>
            <br>- Romans 8:26
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Your wordless groans? They're prayers. Your tears? They're prayers. Your silence? Even that's a prayer. The Spirit is translating your pain into words you can't find.
        </p>
        
        <h2>For the "God, Where Are You?" Days</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-card">
            <strong>"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</strong>
            <br>- Psalm 22:1 (also Matthew 27:46)
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Jesus said these words on the cross. JESUS. If the Son of God can feel abandoned, you're allowed to feel that way too. It doesn't make you a bad Christian. It makes you human.
        </p>
        
        <h2>When You Feel Worthless</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-card">
            <strong>"Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows."</strong>
            <br>- Luke 12:6-7
        </div>
        
        <p>
            On days when I feel like I'm worth nothing, I remember: God knows exactly how many hairs are on my head. He's that detailed in His care for me. Even when I can't care for myself.
        </p>
        
        <h2>For the Endless Night Feelings</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-card">
            <strong>"Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning."</strong>
            <br>- Psalm 30:5
        </div>
        
        <p>
            I know it feels like morning will never come. I know it feels like you've been in this night for months, maybe years. But morning doesn't always come at dawn. Sometimes it comes slowly, in tiny glimpses of light. Hold on for those glimpses.
        </p>
        
        <h2>When You're Too Tired to Fight</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-card">
            <strong>"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."</strong>
            <br>- Matthew 11:28
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Notice Jesus doesn't say "Come to me, all you who have it together." He specifically calls the weary. The burdened. The ones who can barely drag themselves through another day. That's who He wants.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Verses I Keep Screenshot on My Phone</h2>
        
        <div class="gentle-reminder">
            <strong>For Quick Access in Dark Moments:</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>When I feel like giving up:</strong><br>
            "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit." - Psalm 34:18<br><br>
            
            <strong>When I can't stop crying:</strong><br>
            "You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle." - Psalm 56:8<br><br>
            
            <strong>When I feel alone:</strong><br>
            "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." - Joshua 1:9<br><br>
            
            <strong>When I hate myself:</strong><br>
            "I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made." - Psalm 139:14
        </div>
        
        <h2>What These Verses DON'T Mean</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>They don't mean you should stop taking medication if you need it</li>
            <li>They don't mean you shouldn't see a therapist</li>
            <li>They don't mean you're weak in faith if you're still depressed</li>
            <li>They don't mean you should "just pray harder"</li>
            <li>They don't mean your depression is a punishment</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What These Verses DO Mean</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You're not alone, even when you feel alone</li>
            <li>Your pain is seen and it matters</li>
            <li>God isn't disgusted by your depression</li>
            <li>There's no shame in struggling</li>
            <li>You're loved exactly as you are, depression and all</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>For the Really Bad Days</h2>
        
        <p>
            Sometimes, you need the shortest possible lifeline. Here are one-breath prayers for when even reading feels like too much:
        </p>
        
        <div class="resource-box">
            <strong>One-Breath Prayers:</strong>
            <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px;">
                <li>"Help."</li>
                <li>"I can't."</li>
                <li>"Carry me."</li>
                <li>"Hold on to me."</li>
                <li>"Don't let go."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            These are complete prayers. You don't need to say more.
        </p>
        
        <h2>A Note About Healing</h2>
        
        <p>
            I still have depression. I still take medication. I still see a therapist. I still have days when I can't get out of bed. Following Jesus doesn't mean the depression magically disappears.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But here's what has changed: I no longer believe the lie that God is disappointed in me for struggling. I no longer think my depression makes me a bad Christian. I've learned that God meets me in the pit, not just on the mountaintop.
        </p>
        
        <h2>If You're Reading This Right Now</h2>
        
        <p>
            If you're reading this through tears, or from your bed at 3 PM, or while feeling nothing at all – you're seen. Your pain is real. Your struggle is valid. And you're braver than you know just for still being here.
        </p>
        
        <div class="gentle-reminder">
            <strong>Please Remember:</strong><br>
            • Taking medication for depression is not a lack of faith<br>
            • Seeing a therapist is not betraying God<br>
            • Having bad days doesn't mean you're going backward<br>
            • God isn't waiting for you to "get better" to love you<br>
            • You're allowed to not be okay
        </div>
        
        <h2>Resources That Have Helped Me</h2>
        
        <div class="resource-box">
            <strong>Professional Help:</strong>
            <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px;">
                <li>Psychology Today therapist finder</li>
