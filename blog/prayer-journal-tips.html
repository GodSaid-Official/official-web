        <p class="intro">
            I used to pray for things and forget I even asked. Then I'd wonder why God never answered my prayers. Turns out, He was answering all along ‚Äì I just wasn't paying attention. A $3 notebook changed everything.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Three years ago, I found an old prayer list in my Bible. Half the things on it had been answered, but I'd completely forgotten I'd even prayed for them. That's when I realized: my memory is terrible, but God's faithfulness isn't.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why I Started (The Embarrassing Truth)</h2>
        
        <p>
            I was complaining to a friend that God never answered my prayers. She asked, "What did you pray for last month?" I couldn't remember a single specific prayer. Not one. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That's when it hit me: How can I see God's answers if I don't remember the questions?
        </p>
        
        <h2>My Dead Simple System</h2>
        
        <p>
            No fancy bullet journal. No color coding. No Instagram-worthy spreads. Just a cheap notebook and a pen. Here's exactly what I do:
        </p>
        
        <div class="method-box">
            <strong>The Basic Format:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Date:</strong> Write it at the top<br>
            <strong>Request:</strong> What I'm praying for<br>
            <strong>Circle:</strong> Draw a circle next to it<br><br>
            
            That's it. When the prayer is answered, I fill in the circle and write the date it was answered.
        </div>
        
        <h3>Real Page from My Journal:</h3>
        
        <div class="journal-example">
            Jan 3, 2024<br>
            ‚óã Wisdom for job decision<br>
            ‚óè Mom's surgery goes well (answered Jan 5!)<br>
            ‚óã Help with anxiety about money<br>
            ‚óè Find lost wedding ring (FOUND Jan 7 - in toy box!)<br>
            ‚óã Sarah's marriage healing<br><br>
            
            Jan 10, 2024<br>
            ‚óè Clear direction about job (Got clarity Jan 15)<br>
            ‚óã Patience with kids<br>
            ‚óã Dad's salvation<br>
            ‚óè Rent money for February (unexpected bonus Jan 20!!!)
        </div>
        
        <p>
            See those filled circles? Those are answered prayers I would have forgotten about. Now they're evidence of God's faithfulness.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Symbols I Use (Keep It Simple)</h2>
        
        <div class="method-box">
            <strong>My Symbol System:</strong><br>
            ‚óã = Active prayer<br>
            ‚óè = Answered (fill in the circle)<br>
            ‚ü≤ = Ongoing (for things like "patience")<br>
            X = No longer needed/released<br>
            ‚Üí = See page ___ (when prayer continues)<br>
            ! = URGENT<br>
            ‚ù§ = Praise/thanksgiving
        </div>
        
        <h2>Different Approaches That Work</h2>
        
        <h3>The One-Line Method</h3>
        <p>
            Write one prayer per line. Date it. Check it off when answered. Perfect for minimalists.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Categories Method</h3>
        <p>
            Divide pages into sections: Family | Work | Health | Others | Praise. Fill in as you go.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Monthly Review Method</h3>
        <p>
            At month's end, review and mark: Answered, Still Waiting, or Released. Start fresh each month.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Digital Method</h3>
        <p>
            Use a notes app with checkboxes. Search function makes it easy to track long-term prayers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What I've Learned from 3 Years of Tracking</h2>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>üí° Surprising Discoveries:</strong>
            <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px;">
                <li>God answers about 70% of my prayers with "yes" (I counted)</li>
                <li>The "no" answers usually make sense in hindsight</li>
                <li>Many prayers are answered differently than expected</li>
                <li>I pray about the same 5 things repeatedly</li>
                <li>My panic prayers often resolve before I pray again</li>
                <li>Thanksgiving pages outnumber request pages 2:1 now</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Unexpected Benefits</h2>
        
        <h3>1. I Panic Less</h3>
        <p>
            When I'm freaking out, I flip back and see all the previous freak-outs that God handled. It calms me down.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. I'm More Specific</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of "bless my family," I write "help Tom with his math test Tuesday." Specific prayers = recognizable answers.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. I See Patterns</h3>
        <p>
            I noticed I pray about money every month, but God always provides. Why do I still worry? The journal shows me my trust issues.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4. I Celebrate More</h3>
        <p>
            Filling in those circles is satisfying. It's become a celebration ritual. Sometimes I write "THANK YOU GOD!" in huge letters.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        
        <div class="reality-box">
            <strong>Don't Do This:</strong>
            <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px;">
                <li>Making it too complicated (you'll quit)</li>
                <li>Feeling guilty about missed days</li>
                <li>Only writing requests (include praise!)</li>
                <li>Comparing your journal to Pinterest</li>
                <li>Forgetting to look back and review</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>How to Start Today</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Grab any notebook.</strong> Seriously, anything works.</li>
            <li><strong>Write today's date.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Write one prayer request.</strong> Just one.</li>
            <li><strong>Draw a circle next to it.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>That's it.</strong> You've started.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Tomorrow, add another prayer. Or don't. There are no rules except: keep it simple enough that you'll actually do it.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Pages That Matter Most</h2>
        
        <p>
            Every few months, I create an "Answered Prayers" page where I list the big ones. Reading this page on bad days reminds me that God is working even when I can't see it.
        </p>
        
        <div class="journal-example">
            <strong>2024 Answered Prayers (So Far):</strong><br>
            ‚Ä¢ Mom's cancer-free scan<br>
            ‚Ä¢ New job with better hours<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Fixed relationship with sister<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Kids' school situation resolved<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Anxiety medication working<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Dad came to church (!!!!)<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Car lasted another year<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Found community group<br>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            This list? It's my faith-builder. My doubt-fighter. My "God is real and He cares" evidence.
        </p>
        
        <h2>When You Don't Feel Like Writing</h2>
        
        <p>
            Some days I just write: "Same as yesterday, God. You know." That counts. Some days I only write "Help." That counts too. The point isn't perfect prose ‚Äì it's showing up.
        </p>
        
        <h2>A Year From Now</h2>
        
        <p>
            If you start today, a year from now you'll have tangible proof of God's faithfulness. You'll see patterns of provision. You'll notice answers you missed. You'll have a record of growth.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But more than that, you'll have trained yourself to pay attention. To notice. To remember. To celebrate.
        </p>
