            Let me be honest - I've struggled with anxiety for years. These aren't just random verses I googled. These are the scriptures that have literally calmed my racing heart at 3 AM, helped me through panic attacks at work, and given me peace when everything felt out of control.

            If you're reading this with your chest tight and your thoughts spiraling, I get it. I've been there more times than I can count. Sometimes people throw Bible verses at you like band-aids, but that's not what this is. These are the verses that have become my lifelines, and I want to share exactly how I use them.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="verse1">1. Philippians 4:6-7 - When Your Mind Won't Stop Racing</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-box">
            <div class="verse-text">
                "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
            </div>
            <div class="verse-ref">Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV)</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            I know what you're thinking - "Don't be anxious? Easier said than done!" Trust me, I had the same reaction. But here's what changed everything for me: this verse isn't saying "just stop being anxious." It's giving us a practical action plan.
        </p>
        
        <div class="personal-note">
            <strong>💛 My Personal Story:</strong>
            Last month, I was lying in bed at 2 AM, heart pounding about a work presentation. My mind was creating disaster scenarios on repeat. I grabbed my phone, opened my prayer app, and typed exactly what I was feeling: "God, I'm terrified I'll mess up tomorrow. I can't stop thinking about it." Within minutes, I received this verse in response. The act of writing it out, being specific about my fear, somehow made it smaller.
        </div>
        
        <div class="practical-tip">
            <strong>✨ How I Use This Verse:</strong>
            I break it into three steps: 1) Name the specific anxiety (not just "I'm anxious" but "I'm afraid of..."), 2) Turn it into a prayer request, 3) Add one thing I'm grateful for - even if it's tiny. This formula has literally talked me down from countless anxiety spirals.
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="verse2">2. Matthew 6:34 - For Tomorrow's Worries</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-box">
            <div class="verse-text">
                "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
            </div>
            <div class="verse-ref">Matthew 6:34 (NIV)</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            This one hits different when you're a chronic overthinker like me. I used to lie awake creating detailed worry plans for things that might happen six months from now. Sound familiar?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Jesus isn't being dismissive here - He's being practical. He knows we have limited emotional energy, and when we spend it on tomorrow's maybes, we don't have enough left for today's realities.
        </p>
        
        <div class="practical-tip">
            <strong>✨ My Morning Ritual:</strong>
            Every morning when future worries creep in, I literally say out loud: "That's tomorrow's problem." Then I write down ONE thing I need to handle today. Just one. It sounds simple, but it's been life-changing for my anxiety.
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="verse3">3. Isaiah 41:10 - When You Feel Alone in Your Anxiety</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-box">
            <div class="verse-text">
                "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
            </div>
            <div class="verse-ref">Isaiah 41:10 (NIV)</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Anxiety is lonely. Even in a room full of people, you can feel like you're drowning while everyone else is breathing just fine. This verse has been my anchor during those isolating moments.
        </p>
        
        <div class="personal-note">
            <strong>💛 Real Talk:</strong>
            During my worst panic attack (in a grocery store parking lot, of all places), I couldn't remember any verses. My hands were shaking too much to even unlock my phone. But I remembered three words from this verse: "I am with you." I repeated them like a mantra until I could breathe again. Sometimes that's all we need - to remember we're not alone.
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="verse4">4. Psalm 55:22 - For the Heavy Days</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-box">
            <div class="verse-text">
                "Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken."
            </div>
            <div class="verse-ref">Psalm 55:22 (NIV)</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Some anxieties feel too heavy to carry. Bills you can't pay, relationships that are falling apart, health scares that keep you up at night. This verse gives us permission to literally hand them over.
        </p>
        
        <div class="practical-tip">
            <strong>✨ My "Cast It" Practice:</strong>
            I write my worry on a piece of paper, pray over it, then physically put it in a box I call my "God Box." It sits on my dresser. When I'm tempted to pick that worry back up, I look at the box and remind myself: "I already gave that one to God." Is it a perfect solution? No. But it helps more than you'd think.
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="verse5">5. 2 Timothy 1:7 - When Fear Feels Bigger Than Faith</h2>
        
        <div class="verse-box">
            <div class="verse-text">
                "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."

        <p>
            This verse reminds me that the overwhelming fear I feel isn't from God. It's not my identity. It's not my destiny. I have access to power, love, and a sound mind - even when I don't feel it.

            <strong>💛 Truth Bomb:</strong>
            I have this verse taped to my bathroom mirror. Every morning, whether I believe it or not, I look myself in the eye and say: "This anxiety is not from God. I have power, love, and a sound mind." Some days I believe it. Some days I don't. But I say it anyway, and slowly, it's rewiring my anxious brain.

        <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Actually Use These Verses When Anxiety Hits</h2>
        
        <p>
            Look, I know that when you're in the middle of an anxiety attack, the last thing you want is someone throwing Bible verses at you. So here's what actually works for me:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Pick ONE verse to start with.</strong> Don't try to memorize all five. Choose the one that speaks to your current situation and write it somewhere you'll see it daily.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make it physical.</strong> Write it on a sticky note. Set it as your phone wallpaper. Text it to yourself. Anxiety is physical, so fighting it needs to be physical too.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use them preventatively.</strong> Don't wait until you're in full panic mode. Read your chosen verse every morning, even on good days. It's like taking your spiritual vitamins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Combine with breathing.</strong> Inhale for 4 counts while reading the first half of the verse, exhale for 4 counts on the second half. It sounds weird, but it works.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Give yourself grace.</strong> Some days these verses will help immediately. Other days, you'll still feel anxious. That doesn't mean you're failing at faith. It means you're human.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>A Final Thought (From One Anxious Person to Another)</h3>
        
        <p>
            If you've made it this far, you're probably dealing with some heavy stuff. I want you to know that using Bible verses for anxiety doesn't mean you can't also go to therapy, take medication if you need it, or use other coping strategies. God gave us all these tools.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What these verses do for me is remind me that I'm not alone in this fight. That my anxiety doesn't have the final word. That there's a peace available to me, even if I can only grasp it for a few seconds at a time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Start small. Pick one verse. Use it imperfectly. And remember - the God who sees you in your anxiety loves you right there in the middle of it. You don't have to be anxiety-free to be loved, valued, and held.
